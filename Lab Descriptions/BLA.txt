The Bresenham’s Line Algorithm (BLA) is a rasterization algorithm used in computer graphics to draw a straight line between two points on a pixel grid. It determines which pixels should be plotted to form the closest approximation of a straight line without using floating-point calculations, relying only on integer addition, subtraction, and decision-making. It’s efficient, fast, and widely used because it minimizes computation while producing visually accurate lines.
