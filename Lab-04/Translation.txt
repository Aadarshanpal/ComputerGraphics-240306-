Translation in computer graphics is a geometric transformation that moves an object from one position to another 
without changing its shape, size, or orientation. 
It is performed by adding fixed values tx and ty to the original coordinates 
of every point of the object, effectively shifting it along the x-axis and y-axis. 
Using homogeneous coordinates, translation can be represented compactly with a transformation matrix, 
making it easy to combine with other transformations like rotation and scaling in a graphics pipeline.
