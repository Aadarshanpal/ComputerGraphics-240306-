The midpoint ellipse algorithm draws an ellipse
efficiently by using the ellipse equation and incremental 
decision parameters instead of floating-point calculations. 
It works by exploiting symmetry to plot four points at a time and 
divides the drawing process into two regions based on the slope 
of the ellipse: Region 1 where the slope is greater than −1 and Region 2 
where it is less than or equal to −1. Starting from the top of 
the ellipse, the algorithm updates decision parameters to 
choose the next pixel in either the horizontal or diagonal direction, 
continuing until the entire ellipse is drawn smoothly and accurately 
using only integer arithmetic with graphics.h.
