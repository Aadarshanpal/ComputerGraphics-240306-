The Midpoint Circle Algorithm is a classic
scan-conversion strategy used to determine the closest
pixel positions to a perfect circle. Instead of 
using complex trigonometry or square roots—which are computationally "expensive"—it 
relies entirely on integer arithmetic to maintain high performance.

The algorithm works by calculating only a single 45° arc (one octant). 
Since a circle is perfectly symmetrical, 
those calculated coordinates are reflected across 
the axes to fill in the other seven octants simultaneously.

At each step, the algorithm evaluates a "decision parameter" 
to see if the true mathematical circle is closer to the current horizontal pixel or 
the next diagonal pixel. By choosing the one with the least error, 
it creates a smooth, continuous curve using only simple addition and subtraction.
